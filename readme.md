    - All feature and bug fix branches are created off of develop.
    - Team members submit Pull Requests into develop for integration.
2. **Review Process**:
    - Max reviews all Pull Requests for code quality and functionality.
    - Merges into main occur only after thorough testing in develop.
3. **Permissions**:
    - Only Max and Greg can modify the main and Gillbert branches directly.
